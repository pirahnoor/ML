This work is repliction of paper "Neural GPUs Learn Algorithms" Neural GPUs is a neural network model. It performs long bit addition and multiplication. The model aims to process any size of input and producing 100% correct results. The motivation of this work is to be able to parallelize the process of learning algorithms. Since other works done in past are sequential and very deep, that it is difficult to unfold through backpropagation and parallelize the network. Neural GPU can learn long bit binary multiplication and addition. It is trained on a small input size such as 20 bits and tested on relatively very large input size (2000 bits long). It is also capable of learning and performing other tasks such as counting 0s and 1s in an input sequence, copying, reversing or duplicating the input sequence. The lackness in this work is that, it does all these operation on binary input and its performance reduces considerably in decimal representation.
